      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          In South Asia, legal frameworks addressing gender-based violence
          (GBV) are often informed by patriarchal cultural norms that tether a
          woman’s value to her perceived modesty and behavior. This socio-legal
          construct positions women as bearers of familial honor, thereby
          translating notions of modesty into legislative language that
          centers protection over prevention through safeguarding “virtue”
          within the community (Nainar, 2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          Although India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have all enacted laws aimed
          at curbing Gender-Based Violence (GBV), they remain largely
          ineffective due to the vague terminology and their prioritization of
          protecting a woman’s honor, modesty, and social standing over
          justice. This is not uncalled for since the gender imbalance in
          legislative bodies further exacerbates these issues (Naraharisetty,
          2022).
        </p>

        <p>
          According to UN Women, only 15–20% of political positions in India and
          Pakistan, and 20.9% in Bangladesh, are held by women, limiting female
          perspectives in lawmaking and policymaking (UN Women, 2023; UN Women
          Data Hub, 2024). In the absence of gender-inclusive governance, laws
          designed to protect women are frequently authored and interpreted
          through a male-centric lens, resulting in provisions that, while
          well-intentioned, often serve to shield perpetrators and perpetuate
          systemic inequality.
        </p>

        <p>
          A prominent example is Section 354 in the Indian Penal Code (IPC)
          pre-amendment 2013, which describes sexual assault as the intent to
          outrage a woman’s modesty, providing loopholes for the offender to
          argue that their victim does not hold a sense of modesty due to their
          age, caste, or occupation. This was seen in
          <em>State of Punjab v. Major Singh</em> (AIR 1967 SC 63), where a
          sexual offender violated a 7.5-month-old victim, with the main
          defense for the perpetrator being that ‘modesty’ was inapplicable due
          to her age.
        </p>

        <p>
          India has seen some reform in its laws in response to public outrage
          over sexual violence cases over the years. While these amendments
          appear to be protective, their language often reinforces patriarchal
          norms by centering female “dignity” rather than autonomy. Section 509
          of the IPC criminalizes acts that insult the “modesty” of a woman,
          and Section 228-A can result in dehumanization, turning victims into
          symbols of shame and sorrow rather than individuals with agency,
          especially in cases where the victim has passed away and cannot
          reclaim her narrative.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, Pakistan’s Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) of
          2016 is hindered by ambiguous wording and excessive emphasis on
          “morality,” an undefined ideology, even when mentioned. While
          theoretically it provides mechanisms to combat cyber harassment, its
          enforcement is marred by a lack of police training in gender
          sensitivity and digital literacy (Naseer & Ashraf, 2021), due to
          which victims are often silenced by shame, fear, or intimidation from
          law enforcement itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          This incompetence in tackling gender-based violence is seen in the
          2021 case of Marya Zulfiqar, where the Pakistan police force was
          informed about her being threatened and accused of holding her at
          gunpoint, after which the police made no effort to give her
          protection or bring the accused in for questioning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Legal amendments have also been seen in Pakistan, one being the
          Protection of Women Criminal Laws (Amendment) Act 2006, which nominally
          expanded protections but did so through the lens of controlling women’s
          sexual behavior, rather than empowering victims or addressing systemic
          inequalities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas in Bangladesh, steps are being taken to commence a law that
          would benefit victims of cybercrimes such as deep fakes,
          impersonation, and identity theft. The Cyber Security Act, 2023
          (Act No. 39 of 2023) states that anyone who intentionally uses a
          computer network or digital device to assume another person's identity
          or present their personal information with intent to deceive or
          defraud will face a penalty of up to 5 years in prison, or a fine of
          0.5 million Taka (approximately 4,000 USD), or both (সাইবার নিরাপত্তা
          আইন, ২০২৩, অধ্যায় ৬). In addition to the long legal processes, the
          Cybersecurity Act of 2023 is yet to be finalised, which adds further
          hurdles to those seeking justice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bangladesh witnessed its first case of celebrity deepfake in 2023 when
          a sexually explicit video went viral across social media platforms,
          with many falsely claiming that it featured the popular actress
          Tanjin Tisha. Soon after, an online fact-checking and media research
          organization by the name Dismislab confirmed that the video was a
          fabrication. The footage belonged to a pornographic website and had
          no connection to the actress. The digitally manipulated video using
          deepfake technology produced a pornographic video that had Tanjin
          Tisha’s face in another woman’s body (Hossaion, 2024). This incident
          exposed the dangers and vulnerabilities against targeted gender-based
          cyber violence in Bangladesh.
        </p>

        <p>
          A similar case occurred with another actress, Sabnam Faria, who
          publicly addressed the misuse of another person’s pictures digitally
          altered and passed around as hers online. In a candid Facebook post on
          March 31st 2024, she wrote in a resistant sarcastic yet defiant tone:
          “For quite some time now, someone has been editing this person’s
          pictures and putting my face on them, and posting them on Facebook. I
          don’t know who these people are or what they want. Do you really have
          such a strong desire to see me in shorts? When I travel abroad, I
          already post photos wearing shorts! If those photos aren’t revealing
          enough and that disappoints you, then I apologize! But now one of your
          'big brothers' has gone and edited her photo with my face again!!!”
          (Faria, 2024). Unfortunately her slamming remarks weren’t enough to
          stop the culprits. Just a month later, on April 28th, she had to
          address another case of impersonation of herself with an altered photo
          of another person on her social media (Faria, 2024).
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Revenge Porn</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most prevalent forms of Digital Gender-Based Violence is
          Revenge Porn, defined by Merriam-Webster’s dictionary as “sexually
          explicit images of a person posted online without that person’s
          consent especially as a form of revenge or harassment” (Merriam-Webster
          Dictionary, 2015). This form of digital abuse is used to weaponize and
          dehumanize women, signaling their supposed sexual availability on the
          internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common form of revenge porn in South-Asia is the perpetrator
          impersonating the victim online, and creating fake profiles that share
          sexualized imagery under the guise of the victim’s identity. It not
          only violates a woman’s privacy but also directly threatens her
          safety, izzat (reputation), and her life in society, where a woman’s
          perceived “honor” is closely tied to her family’s dignity; being
          falsely portrayed as promiscuous harms her and her family’s social
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phenomenon is seen through crimes like the circulation of revenge
          porn of an ex-girlfriend in response to failed extortion by Bhubaneswar
          in India (Mohapatra, 2024); blackmailing Sanam Maher by an ex-boyfriend
          in Pakistan (Yousafzai, 2022); spreading intimate pictures by the fake
          ID Shimanto Chowdhury in Bangladesh, show the victim’s invasion of
          privacy by an entrusted ex-romantic partner. In all of these cases,
          the perpetrator coerces the victim to comply with their demands or
          face becoming a social pariah.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, revenge porn can also stem from ostracism of individuals as
          seen by the first case of revenge porn in India in 2001, which shows
          that these crimes are not only related to unsuccessful romantic
          relationships but also social ones. A 16-year-old student, who was
          bailed for making a pornographic website of his classmates and
          teachers, who socially ostracised him through provoking and poking fun
          at him. The perpetrator was brought in for questioning and was
          eventually bailed and rehabilitated, since the court deemed this case
          as an example of ‘tech-graffiti’ similar to bathroom graffiti, as a
          concern for his future and well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          As internet accessibility continues to expand, the number of reported
          cases of digital gender-based violence in South Asia increased by 5%
          — reaching 50,035 cases between 2020 and 2021, highlighting the
          growing scope of this issue. Despite this rise, accessible and
          reliable statistical data remain scarce, reflecting a broader
          governmental lack of initiative and concern.

      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          <strong>Izzat</strong>, which directly translates to honor or respect,
          is a deeply rooted cultural concept in South Asia that represents
          social standing (add more here, Aisha). This concept not only applies
          to individuals but also to families aiming to maintain or elevate
          their societal standing, especially for women, who are seen as the
          custodians of honor through ideas of dignity, chastity, and moral
          conduct. This linkage is reinforced through cultural norms, religious
          interpretations, and social practices that prescribe strict codes of
          conduct for women, thereby making female purity and dignity central to
          collective honor.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, women’s bodies and choices become sites of control and
          surveillance in the name of protecting family or community prestige.
          This regulation of women can be broadly categorized into two
          interrelated forms: familial regulation and self-regulation. Familial
          regulation usually encompasses external control by family members,
          manifesting through restrictions online and offline on a woman’s
          social interactions, mobility, and activity. In extreme cases, a woman
          may be subjected to an “honor killing” or “karo-kari,” rooted in
          patriarchal traditions where women are murdered by family members for
          supposed dishonor, through disobedience. Some notable reasons include
          refusing an arranged marriage, adopting Western lifestyles, or seeking
          independence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The case of Qandeel Baloch, a Pakistani social media personality whose
          online presence challenged traditional norms, resulted in moral
          policing and eventually her tragic murder on July 12, 2016, by her
          brother (CITATION). Perpetrators such as Muhammad Waseem were later
          pardoned by her mother under Section 311 of Pakistan’s Penal Code,
          which allows a victim’s family to forgive the assailant—highlighting
          how “honor” is used to undermine accountability.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Consequences of Stigma</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the severity of these societal norms, religious communities
          often frame these acts as “domestic issues,” promoting backward and
          violently patriarchal ideals. Yet Ali &amp; Zafar (2020) argue that
          these crimes are driven by social customs—not Islam. Family honor,
          community pressure, and even admiration for the assailant’s “bravery”
          combine to maintain these extremist practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for comparatively “trivial” consequences, victims may face societal
          restrictions and are often blamed for the crime and its consequences
          due to their actions—whether being outspoken, dressed “immodestly,”
          or walking without a male chaperone (Rawat, 2017). Hence, women facing
          online abuse often refrain from reporting incidents out of fear of
          causing family dishonor, withdrawing from digital platforms
          altogether to protect their families from social scrutiny (Digital
          Rights Foundation, 2020; Internet Democracy Project, 2019).
        </p>

        <p>
          In extreme cases, the law enforcement’s failure to take swift and
          exemplary action against online harm adds to the victim’s fear.
          After a female student from Dhaka University was harassed for her
          clothing, the perpetrator was released on bail within hours under
          pressure from a religious political party. The victim’s personal
          details were shared online, putting her family in immediate danger.
          She said, “I worry whether the state will provide enough security for
          me. I saw the accused being greeted with flowers, while I feel I have
          to cover my face if I leave the house. What would be the point in
          continuing this case?” (The Daily Star, 2025).
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">
          Psychological Impact and Self‐Blame
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the circumstance of losing control over their narrative, social
          ideologies like victim blaming cause extreme psychological distress
          through societal alienation and deep‐rooted guilt—resulting in the
          individual blaming themselves instead of the perpetrators. This can
          manifest as anxiety, depression, and PTSD, contributing to a
          disrupted self‐concept clarity (Ali, 2025; Halder &amp; Jaishankar,
          2013).
        </p>

        <p>
          Digital platforms worsen this dynamic by enabling repeated exposure
          and secondary victimization, reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes and
          social stigmas (Tonny &amp; Nawaz, 2025; Naseet &amp; Ashrad, 2022).
          This vicious cycle normalizes harassment within social and online
          settings, leaving women emotionally burdened by constant threats to
          their safety (Chinchu, 2024; Bessant &amp; Watts, 2021).
        </p>

        <p>
          A longitudinal study of 100 sexually abused adolescent girls found
          that feelings of shame predicted PTSD symptoms six months later, while
          self‐blame strongly correlated with severe depression. Avoidance
          coping (suppressing emotions) and ongoing depression contributed to
          suicidal thoughts—over half of the participants reported suicidal
          ideation. Six months later, nearly half had PTSD symptoms, over a
          third faced depression, and 30% reported suicidal thoughts (Alix
          et al., 2020).

      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          The culture of silence and blame is further weaponized in digital
          spaces, where the rhetoric of the Men’s Rights Movement (MRM) in India
          reframes victims of sexual assault as manipulative and perpetrators
          as victims of a “biased system”; referring to several sections of the
          Indian constitution as “made for the protection of women” despite the
          inherently patriarchal structure of Indian society. These criticisms
          of the law and its enforcers are especially magnified in cases of
          custody, alimony, divorce, and domestic violence (Desai, 2023).
          What began as a purported defense of men’s legal rights has
          increasingly devolved into a justification for misogyny, the dismissal
          of gender-based violence, and the vilification of feminism.
        </p>

        <p>
          The evolution of Web 2.0 saw the growth of platforms like Reddit,
          YouTube, and Instagram, giving a platform for open communication to
          the public and allowing MRM ideologies to take root in anonymous
          online spaces (Desai, 2023). While the manosphere rhetoric originated
          in the West, in South Asia—particularly India—it is shaped by
          socio-religious conservatism and linguistic diversity. A notable
          concept they use is the idea of the <em>Adarsh Bhartiya Nari</em>,
          which translates to the Ideal Indian Woman, who is a submissive
          female archetype, devoutly imbues Indian values to frame feminism as a
          threat to national culture and morality (Priya &amp; Sigamany,
          2025).
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Explicit vs. Implicit Misogyny</h3>
        <p>
          Online misogyny in these regions often manifests in two forms:
          explicit and implicit. Waseem et al. (2017) classify explicit misogyny
          as personal insults to the victim using sexually derogatory targeted
          speech. An example of explicit misogyny is the online harassment Rhea
          Chakraborty faced following Sushant Singh Rajput’s 2020 suicide.
          She was branded a “gold digger” and blamed for his death—despite the
          lack of evidence. In a study examining 2,128 tweets with relevant
          hashtags to the case, the majority contained misogynistic remarks
          toward Chakraborty (Nanditha et al., 2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, implicit misogyny operates through sarcasm,
          cynicism, and subtle accusations (Waseem et al., 2017). Influencer
          Apoorva Mukhija, who had a viral altercation on a talent show called
          “India’s Got Latent,” faced rape, acid attack, and death threats. On
          April 8, 2025, she posted on Instagram titled “and that’s not even
          1%,” sharing uncensored comments she received after the incident.
          Although her supporters offered positivity, many comments resorted to
          sarcasm, speculation, and insinuation—implying she only revealed the
          threats to gain sympathy and downplay the severity of the harassment.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Weaponizing Misinformation</h3>
        <p>
          The deliberate exaggeration and weaponization of misinformation by
          red-pill influencers cultivates mistrust toward women and dilutes
          public empathy toward victims. By selectively amplifying the
          occurrence of false accusations, these individuals fuel a broader
          ecosystem of doubt and misogyny. Their aim is not factual discourse
          but rather disregarding structural gender-based violence and
          reframing male discomfort with shifting gender norms as victimhood.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Bollywood &amp; Regional Cinema</h3>
        <p>
          Cinema in the Indian subcontinent holds deep cultural significance,
          particularly for the middle class, influencing values, identity, and
          gender norms. A key example is the ideal of the <em>Adarsh Bhartiya
          Nari</em> (Ideal Indian Woman), heavily promoted by early Bollywood
          films. These narratives often placed the burden of preserving purity —
          and by extension, the nation’s honor — on women. This is clearly seen
          in the blockbuster movie <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em>. Such
          tropes reduce women to submissive “damsels in distress,” told through
          the lens of a dominant male hero.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even today, films like <em>Kabir Singh</em> (2019) and
          <em>Animal</em> (2023), directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, portray
          misogynistic and hyper‐masculine characters whose abusive behavior is
          glorified (Khan &amp; Taylor, 2023). Despite some progress toward
          more nuanced female roles, mainstream Bollywood continues to objectify
          women through “item songs” and female characters whose worth is tied
          to male redemption (Shewade, 2023).
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Pakistani &amp; Bangladeshi Media</h3>
        <p>
          In Pakistan, mainstream dramas often trivialize domestic abuse,
          pitting women against each other, portraying them as “evil” or
          “promiscuous,” and glorifying patriarchal values (Khan, 2020).
          Ahmar, director of Uks (media advocacy in Pakistan), states:
          “99.9% of dramas on Pakistani television channels are ‘sexist,
          repressive, and regressive’” (Sarfaraz, 2020). Even when some dramas
          push back, the broader industry continues to sideline strong female
          characters and normalize misogyny.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bangladeshi cinema similarly often reduces women to caregivers, victims,
          or objects of desire. Films such as <em>Valobashlei Ghor Bandha Jay
          Na</em> and <em>Poramon 2</em> depict female protagonists subjected
          to violence or exploitation. The “dumb woman” trope dehumanizes women
          by portraying them as naive or weak (Chacchu, 2006; Apu Biswas’s
          character). Such portrayals normalize violence and perpetuate
          misogynistic narratives.

      <h2>Digital Feminism &amp; Counter‐Activism</h2>

      <div class="content-box">
        <p>
          Collective activism and feminist identification have proven effective
          at redirecting shame away from victims and toward perpetrators,
          providing community support (Dey, 2019). Digital feminism in South
          Asia leverages platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to
          amplify women’s voices, share resources, and build solidarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hashtags like <strong>#MeTooIndia</strong> and <strong>#DigitalIzzat</strong>
          have mobilized thousands to share personal testimonies, demand legal
          reform, and hold perpetrators accountable. Feminist collectives host
          online workshops about digital safety, self‐defense, and reporting
          procedures. They also partner with legal aid organizations to provide
          pro bono counsel to survivors of DGBV.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Bangladesh, groups such as <em>Protichi</em> and <em>Priti+</em>
          curate fact‐checked resources about cyber harassment and share
          step‐by‐step guides for filing police complaints under the new
          Cybersecurity Act (2023). They run “#NoMoreSilence” campaigns,
          urging young women to refuse self‐censorship and speak openly about
          their experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Pakistan, <em>War Against Rape</em> and <em>CyberTehrik</em> use
          Twitter threads, live webinars, and digital petitions to pressure
          lawmakers for stricter enforcement of PECA and gender‐sensitive police
          training. They also train grassroots volunteers in rural areas to
          help survivors document online abuse and navigate the legal system.
        </p>

            abusers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Media Monitoring:</strong> Track mainstream media and
            film/television for harmful stereotypes, then publish counter‐
            analyses in digital newsletters and collaborative Google Docs
            (open to civil society groups).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #7a1e1e;">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Digital feminism and counter‐activism are critical to dismantling
          patriarchal narratives online. By building supportive networks,
          offering legal resources, and challenging misogynistic media, South
          Asian feminist activists have begun to shift public discourse toward
          accountability, empathy, and structural change. The journey is far
          from over, but these grassroots efforts demonstrate that collective
          digital resistance can reshape entire cultural paradigms.
