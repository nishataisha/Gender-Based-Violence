                    <p class="person-description">
                        Begum Rokeya (1880-1932) was a pioneering social reformer, educationist, and feminist in colonial Bengal whose advocacy for women’s rights laid the foundation for modern feminist thought in Bangladesh. Rokeya championed female education at a time when societal norms severely restricted women’s access to learning, founding the Sakhawat Memorial Girls’ School in Kolkata in 1911. Her writings, including Sultana’s Dream (1905), employed both imaginative and reformist strategies to challenge patriarchal norms, critique gender inequality, and envision a society where women could participate fully in public, intellectual, and political life. Rokeya’s emphasis on education as a tool for emancipation, combined with her critique of social and religious restrictions on women, established her as a transformative figure whose work continues to inspire gender equity movements in Bangladesh.

                        Ela Bhatt (1933-2022) was a pioneering Indian social activist and feminist whose work profoundly influenced women’s economic empowerment in South Asia. As the founder of the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in 1972, Bhatt organized women working in the informal sector—such as street vendors, artisans, and home-based workers—into a collective that championed labor rights, fair wages, and social security. Her feminist vision combined economic justice with gender equity, emphasizing the dignity and autonomy of marginalized women. Bhatt’s work has had a lasting impact, providing millions of women with platforms for self-reliance, collective bargaining, and leadership, while inspiring feminist labor movements across the region.

                    <p class="person-description">
                        Qandeel Baloch (1990-2016) was a Pakistani social media personality and feminist icon whose life and tragic death sparked national and international debates on gender, honor, and women's autonomy in Pakistan. Known for challenging conservative social norms through bold self-expression and commentary on women’s rights, Baloch used platforms like Facebook and Instagram to confront patriarchal restrictions, question societal expectations, and amplify feminist discourse in a highly restrictive environment. Her activism—though informal and often controversial—highlighted the dangers faced by women who defy traditional norms, exposing the culture of honor-based violence, misogyny, and victim-blaming. Baloch’s life and untimely murder galvanized conversations on digital freedom, women's empowerment, and the urgent need for legal and social protections for women in Pakistan.
